Hello again the last time i was here on crash course we spent a year working our way through the wonders of physics i'm excited to be back again to talk about something even dearer to my heart engineering why am i excited because i'm an engineer but what exactly is engineering a lot of things actually for now we'll just say that the history of engineering encompasses the creation of everything from the physical objects around you to the processes allowing you to watch this video right now that's like really broad i know. Don't worry we'll talk about what that means in a little more detail in our first episode. To coffee cups wireless earbuds to dog whistles artificial hearts to roads and bridges before we do that though allow me to reintroduce myself i'm or shine so mara and i started my science career studying maths and physics at college i then went on to study mechanical engineering and out of everything i learned during my first degree what fascinated me the most was fluid dynamics and understanding how gases and liquids flow so i researched this topic at depth for four and a half years earning myself a doctorate. Of engineering in the process since then i've worked as a science communicator for the bic al jan era and even right here on crash course i'm excited to be back to talk about something that has meant the world to me over the next 46 episodes we're going to get a feel for how engineering and engineers have shaped our world i hope you'll join me and our friends at pcs digital studios on this journey with crash course engineering. You
