In python a sequence is a collection of objects ordered by their position in python there are three basic sequences which are lists tuples and so called range objects but python also has additional sequence types for representing things like strings. Sequence data type will support the common sequence operations but in addition these different types will have their own methods available for performing specific operations sequences are called sequences because the objects that they contain form a sequence so let's look at this as a diagram imagine that this is our sequence and we have a few different objects in our sequence here. Triangles squares and circles in this example the first fundamental aspect to understand about sequences is that indexing starts at zero so if we call this sequences we would access the first element in our sequence by typing a and in brackets putting its location which is zero this object here in the second position would. Be addressed and accessed as s1 and so on this would be s2 3 and 4 another way to access objects within the sequence is not to count from left to right but from right to left so we can access sequences either by giving a positive index which is counting locations from the left to right or we can use a negative index which is counting. Positions from right to left in that case we have to use the negative 1 for the very last object in our sequence correspondingly minus 2 would correspond to the second to last object and so on sequences also support an operation called slicing so let's take a look at that now if we again have our sequences to access a specific unit specific object we would just use. The location for example 2 in this case however if we wanted to extract multiple objects in the sequence we can do the following we can says bracket say 0 2 this first index the first position is the start position and the second position here is the stop position python slices stop before python reaches the element. At the stop location this means that if you types and in brackets 0 colon 2 python is going to return a slice to you which consists of the objects in location 0 and 1 but it will not return to you the object at location 2
