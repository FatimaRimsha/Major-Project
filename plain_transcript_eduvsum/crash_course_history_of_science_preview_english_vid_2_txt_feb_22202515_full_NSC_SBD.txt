Quick question what is stuff maybe that ones too big fine how about this one where are we like all of us earth the solar system the galaxy where the heck are we these questions are a kind of starting point for the scientific method and have been asked by thinkers for a long time they're questions that not only make us try to find answers but make us think about how we find answers. With questions answers and why we ask questions and how we get those answers to that end ever since we started making crash course i've wanted to make a series about the history of science and now i get to do it if we look at that first question i asked what is stuff while physicists will say that stuff is made of atoms and atoms are made of quarks and leptons we still don't know like why quarks exist or why there appears to be far more matter in the universe than we can account for which is weird we don't have the answers yet. We use a method to get at the answers a method that we've been developing for many centuries the scientific method this series is going to be our chance to explore that methods development through the ages from people like aristotle and plato and their weird school cults to the mauryan empire and how they tied science and religion to practical things like irrigation the are industrial world was full of science and people trying to answer big questions both because they were fascinated and because they wanted to not die but we won't stop there. Full of us expanding our knowledge and coming up with new answers to age old questions making planes fly the discovery of dan the space race and yes unfortunately a few bombs have all opened new doors to our understanding of what stuff is and where we are so please join me this year as we look at the storied messy and amazing history of humans figuring stuff out here on crash course history of science.
