These days alchemy gets a bad rap in fantasy stories charlatans and fancy robes promise to turn lead into gold but real alchemists weren't just mystical misers they were skilled experimentalists backed by theories of matter and they played a huge role in the development of our knowledge about one of our fundamental questions what is stuff do chemists today spend a lot of time trying to turn lead into gold no. In part they are inheritors of a wealth of knowledge created by alchemists who were trying to turn lead into gold why did they keep doing that did they all really think that it would work was it some science experiment or religious ritual yes all of those things today we're going to meet some alchemists and consider just what the heck they were doing all day with their metals and how they sought to understand stuff. The word alchemy which is where we get the word chemistry from is a bit of a mystery it might mean the black earth symbolizing egypt but it might not either way all of these words were used in europe before 1600 to describe the same system let's define alchemy as a way of thinking philosophically about stuff by changing it this included older astrological ideas alongside new ones derived from experiment and observation alchemy parallels the scholastic medical tradition we looked at last time. Both systems spanned across eurasia and relied on books but the alchemists had different social norms or ideas about how someone creating knowledge should act alchemists did publish books but typically they encoded their philosophies and complicated allegories or stories wherein the characters and actions stand for something other than what they appear this essentially rendered whole alchemical systems secret except to their own friends they used code words called dec women so tin might literally mean. The metal tin in one book but serve as a code word for silver in another the books were illustrated but many of the images were symbols masking their true meanings the good and the bad thing about the dec tenant system was that anyone could read any pro to scientific treaties on what is stuff and come away with almost any conclusion good thing today we have the internet to help everyone agree on scientific questions based on evidence right a lot of alchemical books focused on transmutation or changing metals into other metals in theory all the way back to. Aristotle transmutation mimicked a natural process metals were compounds formed deep in the earth when different quantities of suffer and mercury were crushed together miners had been working with metals for years digging them up and then heating them to purify them the difference for alchemists though was that transmutation meant hacking this whole process by doing it artificially but the alchemical metals are not compounds of anything they're elements so how do the alchemists take non compounds and read them as. Compounds the alchemists had problems obtaining pure samples when they heated up chunks of metal these would bubble and change color based on impurities meaning tiny bits of other elements but alas metals when isolated don't actually break down into suffer and mercury there were two kinds of alchemical metals the noble metals were gold which represents the sun and silver which represents the moon the base metals included mercury which represented the planet mercury copper for venus iron for warlike mars tin for jupiter. And lead for slow sad saturn in fact our name for the metal mercury comes from this alchemical association with the greek messenger god agents of transmutation also fell into two categories particulars which only did one thing for example change copper into silver and universals meaning the philosophers stone that's the philosophers stone no sorcerers involved american harry potter this mysterious stone could change any base metal into gold the quest for the universal transmutation agent was called chrysoprase. We're literally make into gold to get started a chris pean would combine the right ingredients in an egg shaped vessel called an alembic and then heat the mixture up for a long time what were the right ingredients to make the philosophers stone alchemist disagreed the fact that they didn't agree on what the philosophers stone actually was pretty much symbolizes the whole system chr sophia required fine tuning the practice of metallurgy alchemists had to heat ingredients for days on end controlling the temperatures precisely without the aid of modern labia. Equipment or even a thermometer it was difficult sweaty work eventually the mix of ingredients would turn black then white then yellow and finally red at this point if your oven hadn't exploded you won you now have a lump of red substance that when heated up with base metals changed them into gold supposedly the search for the philosophers stone produced new alchemical theories and felt like a wonder inspiring generations of experimenters even if it never quite you know worked. Alchemy persisted because transmutation clearly produced something including new compounds the problem is that we don't always know what it produced because of the whole secret code thing luna fix a for example was a dense white metal that was corrosion resistant had a high melting point and was pretty soft was it platinum white gold or something else entirely but alchemy was never only about metals the human body for example was understood as an alchemical workshop chemical reactions happening in the organs. Transmuting one kind of stuff into another this is still pretty amazing we eat stuff that is not at all human at least hopefully and then that stuff somehow becomes us in an alchemical framework illness is where reactions gone wrong so while the alchemists included metallurgists mind directors goldsmiths and natural philosophers they were often physicians interested in making efficacious compounds called pharmaceuticals or cam atria in fact alchemy was a system for producing useful materials. From chem atria to alcohol alloys pigments perfumes and cleaning products noble women alchemists tasked with taking care of the health of the workers on their husbands manners played a major role in producing therapeutics these noble women set up production facilities pro to labs and expanded their repertoire of alchemical products which could be sold and the system itself was heavily gendered metaphorically which we can see in many gorgeous illustrations of allegorical kings and queens of heaven the kings and queens of stuff. The wacker life science practices that came out of the ancient and medieval search to understand therapeutic compounds was pali genesis or life again the idea that you could bring things back to life by burning them and then freezing their ashes alchemists spent a lot of time burning and freezing leaves did pali genesis work of why don't you go try it yourself and see if you get better results than they did at least it might make you pay careful attention to living things and what stuff they seem to be made out of. I'm not gonna encourage you to go burn stuff just as there are multiple sciences today there were multiple alchemist in medieval eurasia chinese alchemy was tied into ideas about the earth itself remember how in chinese natural philosophy the earth was one living organism chinese alchemists detected its vital channels of energy transmission using magnets formalizing that system of earth magic called eng shut this work eventually led to the invention of gunpowder chinese alchemy also included a search for immortality called was dan but. Still no sorcerers sadly mostly why don was about self experimentation and diet indian alchemy focused on medicine on forms of mercury and how to preserve health and hopefully create an undecidable body we've talked before about how an ayurveda textbook or samhita had a whole chapter on aphrodisiacs and another on toxicology alchemy supplied a way of developing these love potions and poisons islamic ate alchemy meanwhile blended aristotelian chinese and indian alchemical practices. Jav ere even mayan born in persia in 721 and known in europe as gabon was credited with authoring 3 000 texts these included a version of the emerald tablet a supposedly ancient greek text that included a guide to creating the philosophers stone mayan also worked on mineralogy transmutation and medicinal elixirs and invented new equipment like many alchemists mayan often wrote allegorically trying in his own words to intentionally baffle most readers except those whom god loves. But the person most famous today for his work in alchemy is the swiss physician and iconoclast paracelsus born in 1493 who was also called theophrastus bombast us on blenheim think gregory house meets victor frankenstein meets miss cleo in addition to his general iras ability paracelsus is famous today for the phrase the dose makes the poison paracelsus also believed that the philosophers stone was a universal solvent called the alkanes which was derived from lime alcohol and carbonate of pottery. And could theoretically dissolve anything even gold and most radically paracelsus introduced salt as a third element that made up all metals paracelsus was a critic of university natural philosophers and physicians he saw these scholastic as likely to mistake textual generalizations for truths he admonished his alchemical colleagues not to trust the words of the ancient masters but then he became a master himself someone you could write books in the style of you could say that alchemy like other knowledge making systems was torn down. Between text and experiment that is between loyalty to tradition and iconoclasm and a return to basic observation thus even if alchemical books were often secret concealing gibberish they were important in supporting a long term rational debate about the true nature of stuff in fact the most famous product of alchemy was a wondrous invention that most people don't think of as alchemical at all help us out thought bubble. Was a metallurgist who invented a process for mass producing movable type gutenberg made his type from an alloy of lead tin and antimony creating a more durable system he also pioneered working with oil based ink and made tweaks to the common cheese press to make his printing press his real achievement though was bringing all of these together into a system that made printing books economical and i mean way more economical than having rooms full of monks hand copying manuscripts. Phenomenal printing meant better duplicated texts with fewer errors knowledge circulated not simply thanks to personal travel which was slow and somewhat random but as discrete knowledge some of this knowledge was intentionally secret code which presents a problem for historians today how do we figure out what the alchemists meant when they wrote things like the wind blows over the marriage of the moon and saturn how do we interpret alchemical recipes encoded entirely in pictures thanks thought bubble. What happened to alchemy parts of it became chemistry which of course we'll get to later but alchemy also became increasingly seen as dirty dangerous unsavoury low class and lacking a classical pedigree unlike say astronomy and in europe alchemy was tied to a geocentric cosmology that goes out of fashion in the 16th century still there were notable alchemists in the 17th century including isaac newton but by this time chemists wanted a more scientific society. As practitioners kept doing it in private alchemy went underground for most of the 18th century maintained in secret societies before dying out the once famous book de re metallica or concerning the nature of metals was first translated into english by classicist herbert hoover who was also a president and his wife lou henry hoover in 1912 fascinating next time pack your mortar board hats and masonry tools we're going to track the rise of the university and the cathedral.
