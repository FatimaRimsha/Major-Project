The building you were born in the one where you work and every road you've ever travelled and every bridge you've ever crossed they're all creations of civil engineers civil engineering is one of the most ancient types of engineering focused on structures and buildings of all kinds and it's the accomplishments of civil engineering that our world is built on literally society wouldn't be the same without them if you want to think like a civil engineer imagine that you've just discovered an island a place that no other human has ever seen before. Or set foot on like any good explorer you check out this mysterious island to see what it has to offer as well as what it lacks is there food available and if so where does it grow what about the water supply what's the weather like is the terrain easy enough to travel over let's say that after answering all of these questions you decide that the island is habitable so what if you tried to build a city there what kinds of structures would you need how would you build them and wouldn't matter what order you build them in how do you plan an entire city. You should take a moment to learn a thing or two from the civil engineers that came before us we've been using some kind of civil engineering for most of our history we've built shelters to protect ourselves from the weather and used tree trunks as makeshift bridges to cross rivers our earliest ancestors probably weren't doing any calculations but they were using engineering to find some sort of way to help us. Solutions to their problems and we can find one of the worlds first notable civil engineers about 5000 years ago in egypt this is where we meet imhotep the planner of the first egyptian pyramid he was a government official a sage and even eventually worshipped as the egyptian god of medicine and to that already impressive resume we can add the title of chief of works or what we'd call him engineer imhotep helped oversee the building of the steppe pyramid of sahara constructed in the 27th century be. The limestone based pyramid was about as tall as a modern 18 story building at around 60 meters or 200 feet high and its design and construction helped pave the way for other great civil engineering marvels like the great pyramid of giza this is where we really saw the first two fields of civil engineering come together structural engineering and construction engineering both are similar but structural engineering focuses more on the design and framework of structures while construction engineering is more involved with actually building the structure. To use both of these disciplines if we're going to have any hope of creating a city on our island let's suppose we use imhotep blueprints and build a few pyramids here after that let's move on to something that will definitely need a public water supply for this we can find inspiration in mesopotamia around the year of 691 be this was where the aqueduct of jaw an one of the worlds first notable public waterworks was built by assyrian engineers it was made of millions of stones to carry the water from the mountains to the city of nineveh. Will be crucial to our city will want a public water supply too and a more modern aqueduct system of pipes and tunnels to carry water to homes and buildings and speaking of thinking ahead if you want to learn how to actually map out your future community you have to learn from hippocampus of miletus he lived in greece around 460 be and can be called the father of city planning much of what we know about him comes from aristotle work known as politics aristotle thought hippocampus was weird because he wore his hair long and wore. Flashy jewellery with cheap clothes but even aristotle would agree that hippocampus was also extremely influential many aspects of urban design that we now take for granted like rectangular city blocks and straight streets with avenues at right angles can all be attributed to him in fact this layout is often known as the hippo damian plan and it also involves dividing up cities into different parts for different purposes this is very different from previous designs in his day which often involved streets that curved twisted or ran into dead ends. So let this be a lesson for your island community if you're going to build a city you need a plan and if you don't plan ahead in civil engineering projects you could end up with things in all the wrong places after all you don't want farms and crops near sewage treatment plants or schools next to a noisy airport now we should also take a page from the ancient romans they were some of the greatest engineers of the past with roads tunnels bridges and plenty of aqueducts and water supplies throughout their lands their works are great examples of the third field of civil engineering. Transportation good infrastructure will let you use as much of the island as you can for example roads that run over hills and valleys and bridges for crossing lakes and rivers part of what made romans so prolific in their city designs was the clever use of their environment they mixed limes small rocks and volcanic ash to make their own form of concrete which allowed them to build impressive structures like the pantheon and the colosseum since i don't see many volcanoes on our island we should stick with a more modern kind of concrete like the one patented in early years. 19th century england by joseph aspen he used finely ground stone and clay to make what he called portland cement because of its resemblance to the limestone of portland to england but there are a few better lessons in the importance of building materials than the edison lighthouse the tale of the structure begins at england is edison rocks in the late 17th century and like most great engineering stories it started with a problem the rocks off the coast of cornwall were causing lots of shipwrecks henry win stanley was a painter builder and merchant who lost two ships on these rocks. So he built a lighthouse on them it was octagonal made of wood and lasted for a few years until a storm came through and destroyed it but another builder soon constructed a second lighthouse also made of wood this one lasted for around 50 years but was then burned to the ground from the spark of a candle a reminder of how susceptible wooden structures are to fire it became apparent that the wood wasn't working for this lighthouse so a new generation of engineers had to do something different that's where john sweeting came in instead of wood he began building a lighthouse in 1756. From hydraulic lime a type of concrete that sets underwater this allowed for his lighthouse to last for more than 120 years until 1877 when it was dismantled because the rocks beneath the tower were beginning to destabilize but seasons success in meeting this challenge set the stage for using cement and concrete in structural buildings season is actually the first to label himself as a civil engineer and ever since engineers have had him to thank for separating the civilian side of engineering from the military side. For the lighthouse we're going to build on the south side of our island to warn travellers of the dangerous reef so up to this point we have a pretty good start to our island city we've planned it out with public water supplies roads and bridges a lighthouse and other buildings but we're missing something very important sanitation some form of sanitation has been used since ancient times but a more modern form of environmental engineering began when sir joseph william basil jet designed a sewer network for central london his network helped relieve the city of england. Its cholera epidemic by treating the water and cleansing the polluted river thames which took nearly 20 years to complete and he was eventually knighted for his work this all led to the continued practice of treating drinking water and sewage which will be crucial to maintaining public health on our island there are still more things that civil engineering can do for our city like the construction of dams and canals which falls under hydraulic engineering and then there's working with the rock and soil of the earth so our structures are built on the wright foundation which is the work of geo technical engineers. The idea of creating a city from an empty patch of wilderness shows you how many problems present themselves and how different kinds of civil engineering can solve those problems we've achieved civilizations whole societies because of civil engineering we'll go into more detail in future episodes that will give you an even better idea of the work behind civil engineering but this is just enough to give you if you will a solid foundation today we learned all about many of the facets of civil engineering including structural and construction engineering city planning transportation and science. Next time we'll explore the mechanical side of engineering including its history and the types of work that you might do as a mechanical engineer thanks for watching and i'll see you then.
