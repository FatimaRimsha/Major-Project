Hello world i'm carrie anne and welcome to crash course computer science over the course of this series we're going to go from bits bytes transistors and logic gates all the way to operating systems virtual reality and robots we're going to cover a lot but just to clear things up we're not going to teach you how to program instead we're going to explore a range of computing topics as a discipline and a technology computers are the lifeblood of today is world if they were to suddenly turn off all at once the power grid would shut down cars with crash. Things would fall water treatment plants would stop stop markets would freeze trucks with food wouldn't know where to deliver and employees wouldn't get paid even many non computer objects like data shirts and the chair i'm sitting on are made in factories run by computers computing really has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives and this isn't the first time we've seen this sort of technology driven global change advances in manufacturing during the industrial revolution brought new scale to human civilization in agriculture industry and domestic life mechanization meant superior harvests and more food. Mass produced goods cheaper and faster travel and communication and usually a better quality of life and computing technology is doing the same right now from automated farming and medical equipment to global telecommunications and educational opportunities and new frontiers like virtual reality and self driving cars we are living in a time likely to be remembered as the electronic age and with billions of transistors in just your smartphones computers can seem pretty complicated but really they're just simple machines that perform complex actions through many. Layers of abstraction so in this series we're going to break down those layers and build up from simple ones and zeros to logic units cups operating systems the entire internet and beyond and don't worry in the same way someone buying to shirts on a webpage doesn't need to know how that webpage was programmed or the web designer doesn't need to know how all the packets are routed or router engineers don't need to know about transistor logic this series will build on previous episodes but not be dependent on them. You can better contextualize computing is role both in your own life and society and how humanity is arguably greatest invention is just in its infancy with its biggest impact yet to come but before we get into all that we should start at computing is origins because although electronic computers are relatively new the need for computation is not. Was the abacus invented in mesopotamia around 2500 be it's essentially a hand operated calculator that helps add and subtract many numbers it also stores the current state of the computation much like your hard drive does today the abacus was created because the scale of society had become greater than what a single person could keep and manipulate in their mind there might be thousands of people in a village or tens of thousands of cattle there are many variants of the abacus but let's look at a really basic version with each row representing a different power of 10. Each bead on the bottom row represents a single unit in the next row they represent 10 the row above 100 and so on let's say we have three heads of cattle represented by three beads on the bottom row on the right side if we were to buy four more cattle we would just slide four more beads to the right for a total of seven but if we were to add five more after the first three we would run out of beads so we would slide everything back to the left slide one bead on the second row to the right representing 10 and then add the final two beads on the bottom row for a total of. So if we were to add 1251 we would just add 1 to the bottom row 5 to the second row 2 to the third row and 1 to the fourth row we don't have to add in our head and the abacus stores the total for us over the next 4000 years humans developed all sorts of clever computing devices like the astrolabe which enabled ships to calculate their latitude at sea or the slide rule for assisting with multiplication and division and there are literally hundreds of types of clocks created that could be used to calculate the latitude of the earth. Used to calculate sunrise tides positions of celestial bodies and even just the time each one of these devices made something that was previously laborious to calculate much faster easier and often more accurate it lowered the barrier to entry and at the same time amplified our mental abilities take note this is a theme we're going to touch on a lot in this series as early computer pioneer charles babbage said. Computers the earliest documented use of the word computer is from 1613 in a book by richard brain waite and it wasn't a machine at all it was a job title brain waite said. Built by german polymath got fried leibniz in 1694 leibniz said. Basic abacus this worked in reverse when doing subtraction too with some clever mechanical tricks the step re conner was also able to multiply and divide numbers multiplications and divisions are really just many additions and subtractions for example if we want to divide 17 by 5 we just subtract 5 then 5 then 5 again and then we can't subtract any more 5's so we know 5 goes into 17 three times with 2 left over the step re conner was able to do this in an automated way and was the first machine that could do all four of these operations. And this design was so successful it was used for the next three centuries of calculator design unfortunately even with mechanical calculators most real world problems required many steps of computation before an answer was determined it could take hours or days to generate a single result also these handcrafted machines were expensive and not accessible to most of the population before the 20th century most people experienced computing through precomputed tables assembled by those amazing human computers we talked about so if you needed to know the square root of 8 675 000. Than 309 instead of spending all day hand cranking your step reckoner you could look it up in a huge book full of square root tables in a minute or so speed and accuracy is particularly important on the battlefield and so military is were among the first to apply computing to complex problems a particularly difficult problem is accurately firing artillery shells which by the 1800s could travel well over a kilometre or a bit more than half a mile add to this varying wind conditions temperature and atmospheric pressure and even hitting something as large as a ship was difficult. To look up environmental conditions and the distance they wanted to fire and the table would tell them the angle to set the cannon these ranged tables worked so well they were used well into world war ii the problem was if you changed the design of the cannon or of the shell a whole new table had to be computed which was massively time consuming and inevitably led to errors charles babbage acknowledged this problem in 1822 in a paper to the royal astronomical society entitled note on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables. Charles babbage proposed a new mechanical device called the difference engine a much more complex machine that could approximate polynomials polynomials describe the relationship between several variables like range and air pressure or amount of pizza carrie anne eats and happiness polynomials could also be used to approximate logarithmic and trigonometric functions which are a real hassle to calculate by hand babbage started construction in 1823 and over the next two decades tried to fabricate and assemble the 25 000 components collectively weighing around for the next 20 years. Unfortunately the project was ultimately abandoned but in 1991 historians finished constructing a difference engine based on babbage drawings and writings and it worked but more importantly during construction of the difference engine babbage imagined an even more complex machine the analytical engine unlike the difference engine step reckon on all other computational devices before it the analytical engine was a general purpose computer it could be used for many things not just one particular computation it could be given data and run operations in simple ways. Sequence it had memory and even a primitive printer like the difference engine it was ahead of its time and was never fully constructed however the idea of an automatic computer one that could guide itself through a series of operations automatically was a huge deal and would foreshadow computer programs english mathematician ada lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for the analytical engine saying. Would go on to inspire arguably the first generation of computer scientists who incorporated many of babbage ideas in their machines this is why babbage is often considered the father of computing thanks thought bubble. Of distributing federal funds representation in congress and good stuff like that and by 1880 the us population was booming mostly due to immigration that census took seven years to manually compile by the time it was completed it was already out of date and it was predicted that the 1819 census would take 13 years to compute that's a little problematic when it's required every decade the census bureau turned to herman hollerith who built a tabulating machine his machine was electromechanical it used traditional mechanical systems for keeping count like listen this step by step. Get. In this case to the married total hollerith machine was roughly ten times faster than manual tabulations and the census was completed in just two and a half years saving the census office millions of dollars businesses began recognizing the value of computing and saw its potential to boost profits by improving labour and data intensive tasks like accounting insurance appraisals and inventory management to meet this demand hollerith founded the tabulating machine company which later merged with other machine makers in 1924 to become the international business machines corporation. Or ism which you've probably heard of these electromechanical business machines were a huge success transforming commerce and government and by the mid 1900s the explosion in world population and the rise of globalized trade demanded even faster and more flexible tools for processing data setting the stage for digital computers which we'll talk about next week. Girl and it's okay to be smart this episode was filmed at the chad and stacey mig hold studio in indianapolis indiana and it was made with the help of all these nice people and our wonderful graphics team thought cafe thanks for watching i'll see you later
