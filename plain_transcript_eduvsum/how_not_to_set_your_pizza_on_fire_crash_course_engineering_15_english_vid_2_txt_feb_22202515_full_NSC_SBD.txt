Intro temperature matters in almost everything we do we're trying to heat something up cool something down or just trying to maintain a temperature as an engineer you'll often need to find that goldilocks temperature the one that's just right for your devices and designs but once you've figured that out how do you achieve it well you need some equipment and to learn how to use it more specifically you'll need to know about heat exchangers and how they can affect heat transfer just make sure to watch out for those three bears. So far in this course we've learned a good deal about heat transfer and the different ways heat moves throughout our world we've also talked a bit about devices that help move heat energy like refrigerators and heat pumps and how you can slow down the transfer of heat with layers of insulation but that's just the beginning of the ways you can affect heat transfer there are lots of different types of equipment you can use. They're called heat exchangers because they exchange heat but don't let the simplicity of the name fool you heat exchangers are everywhere they show up as radiators in cars where they transfer heat energy away from the engine so it doesn't overheat you'll also find them in military equipment and power supplies you can even find them in medical devices have you ever had an a ray well a rays actually produce a large amount of heat so they need heat exchangers to draw that heat away to keep it from down to the ground. Even when you create something amazing something that can literally see the bones under your skin you still have to account for its byproducts engineers can't just make a good meal we have to clean up the kitchen too so heat exchangers are pretty important without them there's all kinds of stuff we wouldn't be able to do and the type of heat exchanger you use is even more important because it's not always as simple as heating something up or cooling it down in any way that you can there's a lot more to consider for example let's say you want to heat up your leftovers from last year. Technically you could do that by setting your pizza on fire but unless you'd like your crust extra crispy that seems a bit extreme a much better choice would be a microwave maybe an oven well say your tea is a little too hot to drink and you want to cool it down you could blast it with a fire hose of cold water but that would likely ruin your tea and everything else around it it would probably be better to just wait a bit maybe put your tea in a colder room or leave it in the refrigerator in engineering you need tools and methods that are more than likely to be used. More precise surgeons have their scalpels we have heat exchangers so let's look at the ones we've got the first and most basic example of a heat exchanger is a concentric tube here one pipe or tube is placed inside another one with a cooler fluid moving through the center tube and a warmer fluid moving through the outer tube this fluid might be a liquid or it could be a gas a commonplace you'd find concentric tube heat exchangers is inside air conditioners with concentric tubes and in most heat exchangers you'll encounter. It's important to note that the two fluids are sealed off from each other and never mix but as the fluid moves down the separate tubes energy transfers from the hotter outer fluid to the colder inner fluid through the wall of the inner tube that's the heat transfer in some concentric tubes the fluids will flow in the same direction what's known as parallel flow and other times they'll move in opposite directions which is called counter low whichever way the fluid flows you'll probably want to know just how good the heat transfer is. Of a heat exchanger after all there are two main equations for heat transfer that you can use to figure this out the first looks at each fluid individually and defines heat transfer represented by the letter a as the product of three of the chosen fluids properties it's mass flow rate a or how fast it's moving it's heat capacity a or how much heat you need to raise the fluids temperature and it's change in temperature delta to after it passes through the heat exchanger this equation tells you that no matter what if there's a greater change in fluids temperature. More heat transfer which obviously it also tells you that there's more heat transfer if it's a type of fluid that just generally needs more heat to raise its temperature finally it says it takes more heat transfer to accomplish a given temperature change in a fluid that's moving really fast if each particle of fluid isn't staying in the heat exchanger for very long you need more heat transfer to raise its temperature quickly before it leaves let's say you have a heat exchanger with the colder fluid in the inner tube moving at a high flow rate and the warmer fluid in the outer tube. Even if there's plenty of heat being transferred you might not get a major temperature increase in the inner tube since it has such a high flow rate meanwhile all the heat being transferred to the outer tube will cause a significant temperature change since it's moving so slowly which is what we want the whole point of a heat exchanger is to accomplish that significant temperature change now the other equation for heat transfer also describes it in terms of three properties but it takes both fluids into account the first property is the heat transfer coefficient. Coefficient a which is a measure of how easily heat is transferred between the fluids through whatever is separating them second there's the area a over which the heat transfers and third there's the temperature difference delta to but this time between the two fluids the heat transfer coefficient is actually the inverse of the thermal resistance we discussed last time so the larger the value for a the less resistance there is allowing for more heat transfer this equation also tells you there's more heat transferred when there's a greater area of heat transfer. And no matter what the heat transfer coefficient is or how much contact there is between the two fluids a greater temperature change will always involve more heat you can use these two different ways of defining heat transfer to change your operating conditions as necessary and get the heat transfer you need in the design of the heat exchanger you can affect the heat transfer through the heat transfer coefficient and the area of contact between the fluids and while the heat exchanger is up and running you can affect its heat transfer by the temperature of the heat transfer. Temperature differences between the fluids and their mass flow rates so all of this leads to some inherent problems with the simple concentric tube heat exchanger if the temperature difference between the fluids is the driving force then the heat exchanger will need to have an appropriate area a new value to achieve a reasonable amount of heat transfer there are two ways to increase that heat transfer increase the value of a or increase the value of the area you could increase the heat transfer coefficient by using more conductive pipes or making them thinner. At this point you'll hit a physical limit which leaves you with only one real way to increase the heat transfer increase the area of contact between the fluids for a concentric tube design the only way to increase the area is either by the pipes radius or length which isn't too practical for one thing the heat exchanger will take up more space and it's going to increase not only the cost of the building materials but the operating cost of any pumps pushing the fluid through the device as well if we only use concentric tubes in our designs we'd need more space under the hoods of our system. Our cars and our a ray machines would be even bigger and clunker so it's worth looking at some other heat exchanger designs too take finned tubes for example which you'll often find in industrial applications like power plants industrial dryers and in the air conditioning units of large buildings in these designs fins are added to a tube to increase its surface area which enhances its rate of heat transfer at the same time there are two main types of finned tube designs with axial fin structures fins rung along the tube lengthwise. Where fluid flow outside of the tube is slower and more viscous like oil but you still want to distribute a greater amount of energy with radial fin structures on the other hand discs are added to the tube and spaced out from each other usually in regular intervals this type of fin design is best suited for faster moving fluid like air to flow around the tube another heat exchanger worth looking at is the plate heat exchanger which uses metal plates to transfer heat between fluids with these the warmer fluid flows the tube. Through one port and the colder fluid flows through another typically in counter low both fluids are restricted by seals so they can only flow in a certain path kind of snaking their way through the exchanger the fluid between each set of plates alternates with the plates providing a large surface area for a high rate of heat transfer so plate heat exchangers would be a little better than concentric tubes for something like an a ray machine since it produces a lot of heat you'd want to get rid of now both thin tubes and plate heat exchangers are usually a step up from. And. So you can put baffles which are obstructing veins or panels inside the shell to drive the shell side fluid through in a maze like pattern baffles not only help increase the overall average heat transfer through the system by directing the flow of the fluid but also by increasing the shell side velocity and promoting turbulence so between concentric tubes fin tubes plates and shell and tube designs you've got plenty of options when you need to transfer heat which among other things means there's no need to say that you're not going to have to do this. Set any pizza on fire that would just be a travesty today we learned all about the different types of heat exchangers and how they can be used to transfer heat we started off with concentric tubes and the two main equations that can help us define heat transfer in heat exchangers then we flowed on over to fin tubes and found the differences between axial or radial fins finally we covered plate heat exchangers and studied the most common heat exchanger design shell and tube i'll see you next time when we'll continue on our journey and learn all about heat exchangers.
