Whether you're heating up leftovers from last night or just trying to stay cool in the summer heat transfer is everywhere in some ways the world is literally built around it any well engineered building is designed and made out of materials that help keep the inside of the building at a good temperature even during bitter blitzes or horrendous heat waves a furnace or a will only get you so far without protecting against heat transfer you might as well try to air condition your whole neighbourhood. Your knowledge of natural processes to keep them from interfering with whatever you're trying to do or in some cases taking advantage of those processes so without a solid understanding of how and why heat moves the way it does your designs won't be very successful especially if you've just discovered a tropical island. It's more totally deserted and seems like the perfect place to build that vacation home you've always dreamed of the tropical weather is really nice but it's also hot very hot so you'll probably want to design your house to keep the heat out and the cold in in other words you'll want to prevent as much heat transfer as possible even though heat isn't a fluid itself heat transfers in a way that's kind of similar to the fluid movement we've talked about in past episodes when fluids move there's always a driving force behind them specifically a difference in either pressure or velocity. With heat transfer the driving force is a difference in temperature in fact if you don't have a temperature difference you can't have heat transfer period if you have two boxes right next to each other and they're both at the same temperature then one of the boxes won't randomly start giving its heat energy away to the other one but if you're watching this video on your laptop and it's well on top of your lap then your legs might be warming up as the heat is transferred to them from your laptop that's because right now your laptop is warmer than your skin and when heat passively transfers. It always moves from a higher temperature to a lower one you'd have to use the cycles and work energy we talked about before basically an engine to make it move in the opposite direction and unless you have perfect insulation which is practically impossible in most settings then a temperature difference will cause heat transfer so this house you're building is going to heat up from the warm tropical air no matter what but there's a lot you can do to slow down the process there are three main types of heat transfer to look out for conduction convection and radiation. In addition heat energy is transferred by the collisions of molecules or other particles when two things touch the faster moving molecules of the warmer object crash into the slower moving molecules of the colder object transferring energy that heats them up in your house that will cause heat transfer through the layers of the walls as the outer layer warms up conduction will transfer the heat through to the cooler inner layers to slow this down you'll want to build the walls out of a material with low thermal conductivity something that doesn't transfer heat well. Has a high thermal conductivity so if you made your walls out of it you'd effectively be making a giant sauna which doesn't sound like a great place to live for one thing it would probably be a burn hazard materials like brick and drywall on the other hand have lower thermal conductivities so there's be much better choices anything that solders insulation also has a very low thermal conductivity so you'll probably want some layers of that too the thicker these layers the more resistant the walls will be to heat transfer by conduction specifically they'll have more of what's called thermal resistance. Which is defined as the thickness of the layer of the material divided by the materials thermal conductivity and the area of the layer all this means is that materials with a lower thermal conductivity have a higher thermal resistance and that a thicker layer will also have a higher thermal resistance but if there's more area for heat to be conducted through that will lower the thermal resistance thermal resistance is also equal to the temperature difference divided by the heat transfer rate which also makes sense it means that for a given temperature difference materials with a higher heat transfer rate. The heat transfer rate will have a lower thermal resistance and vice versa you can use this equation to determine the level of thermal resistance you'll need if you want a low rate of heat transfer for the temperature difference you'd expect to have in the layers of your walls and the resistance of the different layers adds up so the total thermal resistance of the walls is equal to the resistance of each layer combined it's like putting on layers of clothing on a cold day the more layers you have the lower your rate of heat loss will be and the easier it is to stay warm. If you're in a room with a lot of heat transfer you can use a new method of heat transfer. It's showing its density that warmer air rises taking heat energy with it and is replaced by cooler denser air that's called natural convection because variations in the temperature of the fluid create natural movement without any external forces there's also forced convection where something external like a fan or the wind moves the fluid heat transfer by convection actually involves some conduction especially at first when the warm outside air comes into contact with your houses walls it creates the no slip condition we've talked about before where the layer touching the surface. Surface comes to a stop right on top of that there's what's called a boundary layer where the air is moving but slowly the lower velocity slows down the rate of heat transfer creating a thermal boundary layer where there's more conduction between the particles and less convection beyond the boundary layer though heat transfer mostly happens by convection through the faster moving air you can measure how much heat is being transferred by convection using what's known as the convective heat transfer coefficient represented by the letter a it's proportional to the thermal conductivity of the fluid. Over the thickness of the boundary layer which just means that thinner fluids with higher thermal conductivity will transfer more heat makes sense age also depends on how fast a fluid is moving the lesser gas moves around the less heat is transferred through convection that's why windows often have double panes the air trapped between the layers of glass can't move very much reducing the heat transfer so double pane windows are probably a good idea for your house there's not much else you can do to minimize the effects of convection since you can't really control what the air does. As it moves around outside but you can reduce the effects of the last type of heat transfer radiation radiation is the transfer of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves and in this context we're talking about any electromagnetic waves not just the cancer causing kind you feel this radiation every time you walk outside and bask in the sun or warm up by a fire unlike conduction and convection radiation can happen without any contact between the heat source and the object that's why heat energy from the sun is able to reach the earth. So the paintings can help reduce the heat transfer from radiation a little since they absorb fewer electromagnetic waves but when it comes to radiation where your house is will be much more important than what it's made of since the sun will likely be the biggest radiative source you'll want to build the house somewhere where it won't get too much direct sunlight so there's a lot of factors to consider when you're trying to minimize heat transfer but with a shady spot walls with lots of thermal resistance and some double paned windows you should have a pretty comfortable place to hang out on your tropical island. So today we learned all about heat transfer and the different mechanisms behind it we started with conduction and learned about the thermal conductivity of materials then we moved on to convection and boundary layers learning that convection can be both forced and natural finally we covered radiation and how it differs from the other two methods in that it doesn't need an intervening medium to transfer heat energy next time we'll talk about how we can use what we just learned about heat transfer and apply that to heat exchangers.
