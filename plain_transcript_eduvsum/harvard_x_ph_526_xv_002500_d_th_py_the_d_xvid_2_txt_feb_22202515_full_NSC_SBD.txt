Ranges are immutable sequences of integers and they're commonly used in for loops to create a range object we type range and then we put in the stopping value of the range now we've just created a range object but this is less helpful if we would like to see what's the actual. The range object. The stopping value that's why range 5 does actually not contain the number 5 we can provide additional arguments to the range function for example we can provide the starting point and we can also define the step size so if we type range 1 to 6 in that case we get a range object which starts at 1 and ends at 5 if we wanted to go. So we could do something like this we could start from one go up to 13 number 13 not itself included and we could go in steps of two in this case we get a range object that starts at one and ends at 11 typically when we use range objects in our python programs we do not first turn them into lists we've done it here only so that it's easier for us to understand. And what these objects do you can certainly use a list object in a for loop context but it's problematic for the following reason to store a range object python is only storing three different numbers which are the starting number the stopping number and step size if you have a very large data set that contains say 10 million objects if you first create a list that contains the indices for accessing these 10 million. In numbers you've just wasted a lot of space just to be able to loop through your data consequently use range objects as is don't turn them into lists before using them
