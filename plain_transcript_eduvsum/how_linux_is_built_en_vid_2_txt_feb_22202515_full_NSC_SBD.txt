You use linux every day whether you know it or not over 850 000 android phones running linux are activated every single day compare that to just 30 000 windows phones according to the latest reports that means 100 android devices have come online just since you started watching this video nearly 700 000 tvs are sold every day. Most of which are running linux eight out of ten financial trades are powered by linux nine out of ten of the worlds supercomputers run linux google twitter facebook and amazon are all powered by linux so how is linux developed to achieve all of this unlike other operating systems like windows or is linux is built collaboratively across companies geographies and markets resulting in the largest collaborative development project. In the history of computing just since 2005 about 8 000 developers from almost 800 companies have contributed to the linux kernel these contributions have resulted in 15 million lines of code 1 5 million lines written in just the last couple of years consider that homers epic iliad poem is a mere 15 000 lines of text the novel war and peace just 560 000 words but it's not just about the shared message. A number of lines of code it's also about how quickly linux is developed and released for example a major new kernel comes out every two to three months compare this to years for competing operating systems this is made possible by a unique collaborative development process when submitting code to the linux kernel developers break changes into individual units called patches a patch describes the lines that need to be changed added or removed from the source code each patch can add a new feature new support for a device. When the patch is close to being release ready it is accepted by a senior linux kernel developer or maintainer who manages one or more of 100 different sections of the kernel while this isn't a guarantee that it will go to the mainline it's certainly a good sign here it gets an even more extensive evaluation when the maintainer finishes their review of the kernel it's not a guarantee that it will go to the main line it's certainly a good sign here it gets an even more extensive evaluation when the maintainer finishes their review of the kernel it's certainly a good sign. You. Computing and more what's next because together we're ready
