YOU LIVE IN A WIRLD OF CREATIONS SALL OF THE THINGS YOU SEE AROUND ME WERE CREATED BY PEOPTHE TET NOLOGY THAT'S BEING USED TO RE CORD ME AND WATCH MY WERE MIKWISE CREATIS AND NOT BY LEENGINEERSES BUT BY WHOLE TEANS SOME TIMES ENTIRE GENERATIONS OF CLEVER DESINERS THOSE DESIGN ERS WHERE ENGINEERS AND ENGINEERS AR WHEN E COMES RIT DANTOI CREATORS SO WID ENGINEERING ITSELF COMES FROM THE LATON ENGINEUN MEANING CLEVERNESS AND ENGINARE MEANING TO DESIN OR DEVICES SO NAT MAKE SENS BECURS YOU HAPTO BE CLEVER IF OU GAN ASSOLVE THE PROBLEMS THA ENGINEERS FACE EVERY DAY AND YOU MIGHT THINK OF ENGINEERING AS HE KIND OF SCIENS AND NOT'S NOT WRONG BUT IT'S MORE USEFUL TO THINK O SCIENCE AS A TOOLL AT TALL THE ENGINEERS YUS ALONG WITH MATHMATIVS TO PERFORM THEIR UNIQUE DUTIS THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE WERK ENGTISHOW YOU JUST WHAT YOU CAN ECOMTLISH THROUGH ENGINEERING MATTES AT THE CALL OF ENGINEERING BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT AF THE IDEERS AND THE APPLICATIONS THEY HOLP US UNDERSTAND HOW WE USE MAT TO SOLVE PROBLEMS SO WE'LL BE TEACHING YOU SOM MAT BUT ALSO THE CONCERTS AT THOSE OCRATIONS EXPLAIN IN THEIR OWN WAY WE'LL SURVEY WHAT WE'VE ALREADY ACHIEVE EXPLORE WHAT WAS STILL DISCOVERING AND DREAM ABOUT WHAT WE HOPE TO MAKE POSSIBLE AND WILL SHOW YOU THE IDEERS OU CAN ES TO ENGINEER GREAT THINGS WE WANT YOU TO BE IN S PIRED AND AS ENTERESTED IN ENGINEERING AS WE ARE THAT'S WHAT THIS CURSE IS ALL ABOUT I'M DOCT TOSHINES SO MARA AND THIS IS CRASH COURSE ENGINEERING A MAGINE YOUR WALKING THROUG TOWN MAY BE ON YOUR WAY TO CLASS OR TO THE JIM ART TON WETING FOR WORK AND RI THERE ON THE PAVE MEN YOU COME ACROSS A BLOB OF SOMETHING IT'S SARLY LARGE AND BLUE AND YOUGELY PRETTY STRANGE RY WHAT E YOU DO WELL YOU'RE A CURIOUS PERSON AND YOU NO A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC IN QUIRIE SSO YO WANT TO USE SIENS TO STUDY THE BLOB MAYBE YOUR BACKGROUND IS IN CHEMISTRY SO YOU MIGHT ANALYZE THE BLOBS O MILECTULAR STRUCTIER WOR THE CHEMICAL COMPOEN ANS INER  TO TRIFIGURE OUT WHAT THE BLOBAS MADO OR MAY BE THE BLOBERS MOVING OR MAKING SOUNDS TAND YOU THINK OT MIGH BE ALIVE SO YOU MIGHT TRTISY HOWRAT RES PONS TO SAY WATER OR A POPE WOF YOUR PEN MAYBE YOU EVEN DESIDE TOR AND MOVE A SAMPL OF IT TO LEARN ABOUT THE BLOBS PIOLOGY YOU COLYVEN LICIANEER FROM THE PESPECTOF O FHYSIVS AND SE HOW IT OPERATES AND MOTION MAYBE THIS GO HAS SOME SPECIAL PROPERTIS SANY OF THESE WRES BONCES WOULD BE A PROACHING THE SITUATION AS A SCIENTIS YOU CURIOUS ABOUT THE BLOB AND WANT TO UNDERSTAENIV THAT'S SCIENCE SIENTIS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE FROM OUR EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE OF SPACE TO THE TINIEST PARTICLES FOUND IN THE TOBIF YOUR PENCIL TE ENGINMEERS WANT TO TAKE THE ANCERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS AND SOLVE PROBLEMS SECAUSE IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING CLEVER THINGS WHAT ENGINEERING REALLY DOS I SOLVE PROBLEMS SAND THE GOOD NEES IS YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO THINK LIKE AN ENGINEER YOU'VE DABWLED AN ENGINEERING IF YOU'VE EVER WANDED WHAT YOU CAN DY WITH SYOU'VE YUWSE YOUR ENGINEERS MIND IF YOU WENT OUTSIDE ON A SNOWING MORNING AND BUILTO SNO MAN AFTIFIGURING OUT THE PACKING PROPERTIES OF THE SNOW A'MD NOT SAYINGYOU TO PUT THOU ON YOUR RESEME YOU DOU GET A THUMS OB SO FROM AN ENGINEER EN PORSPECTIVE YOUR RESPONCE TO THE MAS STERIOUS SIDEWALK BLOB WOULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENG BUTET MAY DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF ENGINEER YOU ARE TO TAY ENGINEERING IS MUCH BROADER AND MORE VERI THAN IT USED TOBE THAT'S BECES ENGINEERING ARE RIGINALLY REFERS SPECIFICALLY TO MILITARY ENGINEERING MILITARY ENGINEERING INVOLVES DESINING AND BUILDING MILITORY WORKS ALONG WITH WAYS OF COMMUNICATING AND TRANCSPORTING PEOPIL AND THINGS SINK OF CATEPOT TREBYSHOS AND SEGETOWERS THESE TIT OF WAR MACHINES AND MILITRY STRUCTORS HAVE BEEN FOUND AS FAR BACKAS THE ELEVENSENT WHO B C E  SH PY THE BABYLONIANS AND ASSYRIANS YOU NEEDED A GOOD ENGINEER IF WO WANTS TO STORMER CASTLE SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS FIELD THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT AN ENGINEER MI WANT TO SOLVE IS SIMPLY HOW TO DESTROY THE BLOB AR TO PROTECTOS OURE FROMIT NOW THE FIRST OF THE MODERNFILLD OF ENGINEERING TO EMERGE AFTER MILITARE ENGINEERING WITH CIVIL ENGINEERING THIS BRANCH HAD ITS OFFICIAL START AROUND THE EIGTEENT CENTURY LIGH THEN AME IN PLIE CIVIL ENGINEERING WAS  USE FOR CEVILLIAN PUROSES RATHER THAN MILITARY ONES IT FOCUSES ON BUILDING STRUCTOS OF ALL CINES ALON WITH HIGHWAYS SANITATION SES TONS AND EVEN IN TIECIS SUNDER THIS BRANG OF ENGINEERING WE MIGHT WANT TO STUDY THE BLOB TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PROPERTIES AT HAS THAT CAN BE USED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF DAILY CIVILIAN LIFE SI MAYBER THE BLOBS GO IS BETTER INCULATING MATERIAL THAN WHATS CURRENTLY IN YOUR HOUSE OR MAYBE IT TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY ELASTIC OR WATERPROOF ER HAVE SOME OTHE PROPERTY THAT CAN MAKE IT USEFUL IN CONSTRUCTION INFORSTRUCTURE OR URBAN LANIC THE NIGTY AN S ENTORY LED TO AN INCREASING FOKERS ON THE MACHINERY INDUSTRY WHICH GE'VE RISE TO THE BRANCH OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING WHICH I MUST SAY IS HE MECHANICAL ENGINEER MY SEL ITSTH FINE DISCIPLIN THIS BRANCH FOKUSS ON MACHINERY AND MECHANICAL SISTONS FROM ROBODS TO ENGIONS SOMMES AVERY AND  COMIS NEU COME AND TWO INGLITIAN V ENTORS WHO WERE CREDITED WITH CREATION THE STEAM ENGIN IN THE EARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRERS WER BOTH MECHANICAL ENGINEERS SAND SO WIS JAMES WAT THE SCOTTISH SCIENTIS WHO MADE THEIR DESIN MUCH MORE EFFICION BY RECACTURING STEEM IN THE ENGI THE IN DUST YAL REVOLUTION WAS LED BY MECHANICAL ENGINEERS LIKE THER THEN ELECTRICAL ENGINERING WAS A NATURAL PROGRESTION ONCE WHO WERE ABLE TO GENERALY ELECTRICITY IN CREAT ELECTRONICS SATING THATS FTHE ENTIN S ENTORY A LECTRICAL ENGINEERING DUILLS WUL DEVICES AND SISTONS THAT COMRANGE ENY WERE FROM MIKCHIRCSAN SELFOS THE JIN POWERSTATION GENERATOS THAT HELP SUPLI ENEGY TOBIG CITIES SE LETRICARN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OFTEN COMETOGETHER TO CREATES SOM PRETTY FANTASTIC INVENTIONS SIF YO WANT TO ROBOT THAT CAN MOVE ABOUT LIKE WE DO YOU'LL GENTINEED THE MECHANICAL ENGINEER TO SET UP THE SKELITON OF THE MACHINE THEN TO GIVEIT A HART OF ELECTRICITI  YOU'LL NEEDONE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER TO PROVIDE POWER TO THE ROBOB WITH ELECTRONICS AND IF YOU WANTIT TO ACT LIKE US TO YOU'LL NEEDS SOME ONE SKILLD IN CON PUTER SCIENS SE ENGINEERING DOESN'T STOP THERE AND NOTHER FIELD WASS FOUNDED IN THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY CEMICAL ENGINEERING THESE ENGINEERS HAVE QUITO WIDE FOKER NOT ONLY DESIGNING AND OPERATIN CHEMICAL PLANE THAT DO THINGS LIKE REFINE OIL AND DI STILL ALCOHOL THEY ALSA DEEL WITH FU MEDI THN IAN THE EN VIRONMENG CAND MUCH MORE THERAN VOV NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESEVITEVS THAN ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS FOUND IN THE PECS OPOCKET YOU AT LAST NIGHT BUT ALSO WITH THE MEDICONE YOU TOT THE NEX DAY TO HELP YOUR UPSET STOMIC TOGETHER SCIVIL MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL AND CHEMICO ENGINEERING ARE OFTEN SCEENERS THE FOUR MAIN BRANCES OF ENGINEERING IN THE MODERN WORLD TUT THERE ARE MANY MORE FIELS THAT SPECIALIZE EVEN FURTHER WE HAVE AROSPAC ENGINEES BUILDING MACHINES THAT FLI IN THE AIR AND SPACE YOU CLEAR ENGINEERS HARNESSING ENGY RELEASE FROM NEUCLYA REACTIONS AND BY THE MEDICAL ENGINEERS CREATING MENICAL EQUIPMENT AN DEVICES TO SOLVE CLINICAL PROBLEMS THE LTHIS GOES ON AND ONE BRANCH THE TO PORS ALL OF THEM IS INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERIN ENGINEERS IN THIS FIELD TDESINE AND OPTO MISES THE FECILITIES EQUIPMENT AND SYSTONS THAT MANY OTHE ENGINEERS YUS TO CREATE THEIR PRODUCTS SHINK OF THEM AS THE SU PORT CLASS OF THE ENGINEERING WOD THEY PROVIDE THE AL IMPORTIN GROUND WORK FROR MANY OF OUR ENGINEERING ADVANCES WE'LL NEEDS TOM IN DUSTRIAR ENGINEERS TO HELP US WITH OUR FACTORY WHEN WE START MANIFACTURING ARE COOL NEW PRODUT BHAYSED ON WHENEVER THIS BLOB IS MADE OF WEVE THE PAR OF ENGINEERING ATS AR FINGITIS WE'VE AL READYO BEENEEBLE TO DU SOM PRETTYAMEZING THINGS WE'VE BUILT SPASHIPS TES THANT PEOPLE TO THE MOON AND GIVEN MARS OF FEW ROVERS WHICH ARE FANTASTIC WORKS OF ENGINEERING THEMSELVES SE'VE MADE ARTIFICIAL HARS TO PUMP BLODTRY THE HUMAN BODY AND ARTIFICIAL LIMBS TO REPASE THE ONES THAT WE'VE LOST WE'VE DESIGN SCITGROPERS THAT WAVER THE CLOWS AND SHOW THE WORLD JUST HOW HI WE CAN REE SHAND WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN IN THE FUTURE IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT WILL SEE ADVANCES LIKE CAN ARTIFICIAL PANCREES THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY CURE TIGHT ONE DIABETIES AND NOU NANA TERNONOGY THAT WILL SHOW THE MITT OF BEING SMALL AND ROCKETS THAT WILL FINALLY SEND PEOPLE TO MARS TO HANG OUT WITH THOSE ROVERS THIS AND MUCH MUCH MORE CUT ALL COME FROM ENGINEERING MAYBE ONE DAY YOU'LL BE THE ONE TO CREATES SOMETHING TRULYAMATING AS FOR THE BLOB YOU FOUND ON THE PAVEMEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT
