YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT A SCIENTOF GREVOLUTIONAN EUROLASTING FROM ROT IT THE MIN FIFTEEN HUNDREDS TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND WE HAV SOVERY GOOD STORIES TO TELL FROM THIS PERIOD A FIRST LET'S TALK HISTORIOGRAPHY OR HOW HIS STORIANS HAF POL HISTORY DIFFERENTLY OVER TIME THE TRP OF THE SCIENTIFIC VOLUTION IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR ORGANIZING OF VENTS IN OUR STORY BUT IT ALSO OBSCERS OTHER POSSIBLE
