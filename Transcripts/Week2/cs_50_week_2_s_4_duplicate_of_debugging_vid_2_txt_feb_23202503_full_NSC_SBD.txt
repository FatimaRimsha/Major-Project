Welcome everyone my name is carter and today i'll show you my secret program you can run the program by typing secret into your terminal and if you type in the right password you should be able to see come on in so let's try it out i'll do secret and maybe i don't know the secret phrase so i'll just say let me in and at which point i don't get any response so let me try it again and do secret maybe password is the password here but it's not and i'll just reveal to you that the password is please. If i type dot slash secret and i type in please i should see come on in but i don't and so what's the problem here well maybe i should look into my code and maybe step through it bit by bit so i'll do code secret dot a and i can see the very top of my code starting with this int main void function to step through my code remember we can use debug50 to set a breakpoints or place a pause in our code so i can go to this left side here find a pale red circle. And turn it into a bright red circle as i click it and set that pause point or that break point now i can do debug50 of secret and then my code should boot up and i should be able to pause right at that moment i'm asking the user for their secret phrase of course i have to actually step over that line for it to actually run in my program so i'll then step over and i can type in my secret phrase of please of so that seems pretty good i see that phrase becomes please and correct it's secret. Currently false but it should change to true after i do this check phrase function so i'll step over check phrase and i see it's actually still false and so of course if i run past line 13 nothing will happen i actually won't print to come on in so at this point debug50 seems to be not really helping me here right i've walked through my entire program but i haven't seen what went wrong in my code well debug50 has this option to step into a function actually dive in into what's happening underneath that hood of that function. So what i can do is go to debug50 again and run debug50 with secret wait for my code to go to that breakpoints again and i'll walk through that first piece where i type in my phrase please but now instead of stepping over this check phrase function i actually want to dive into it and see what's going on underneath there so i'll do step into in debug50 and then see i'm setting my password to be please so if i step over i'm going to type in the first piece. For line 22 i should see that password becomes please as it does on this left hand side and now when i check for if phrase is password i should actually be able to return true because it seems that phrase is the same as password so i'll step over that and see actually i get to line 29 and this is kind of subtle but in a you can't compare two strings using two equal signs you actually use a different function called string compare or str cup for short so to use str compare i'm going to use str compare. I can use str cup and give it two arguments phrase and password and with these two inputs str compare will tell me are they exactly equivalent or not if they are equivalent str cup or str compare will give me 0 as a value back so now my code is saying if these strings are equivalent and i know they are because str compare has given me 0 i can go ahead and return true and say this is the correct password so with this new code here i should be able to exit debug50. And go back to the terminal and now i can make secret again run secret type in my password of please and now there it is it says come on in and with that we've seen how debug50 can help us not only step over our code but dive into functions and see the bugs inside of them
