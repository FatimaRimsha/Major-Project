Welcome everyone my name is carter and today i'm going to show you my guessing game and how i can use debug50 to help figure out what's wrong with it so here i'm trying to write a guessing game there's sort of in the spirit of the elementary school game where you would guess a number and someone would tell you it's right or wrong and i called my program guess so i can run it in the terminal with guess here i could guess hit enter and i have to guess a number so here i might guess maybe 2 and hit enter but then i get this flood of messages in the terminal and i'm wondering well what's. And to try to figure that out i can go into my code with code guest a and then i can see well i'm not entirely sure what might be wrong here so i need to pause my code at some point and for that i can use a breakpoints so let me go ahead and go to this left side of my guest a file where i see these red sort of circles pop up and i can click on one of them to turn it bright red and at that point i set a pause point in my window. I can use debug50 to go in and actually step through my code and see what's going on in there so i'm going to go ahead and type debug50 of guess hit enter so now that i have my code opened up in debug50 i can see a few different things i can see that my number variable is currently set to 0 and my guess is currently set to this odd 32 764 but as i go through my code i'll actually see those numbers sort of fall into place so if i use this stopover button. Sort of walks the next line of my code i can see that number becomes 5 as i expect it to on line 6 and then as i go to line 8 and step over that i get prompted for what's my guess and at that point i might type well 3 again and i'll hit enter and then i see guess becomes 3 so now i'm wondering well if my guess is wrong and my number is 5 my guess is 3 shouldn't i only get wrong guess just once so i'll actually just keep walking through my code. Code with step over and i'll see i'm printing wrong guess which seems right and now i should just exit the program that should be it but i really see that my line in that yellow highlight is going back up to 10 line 10 there and it's actually continuing to go through and print wrong guess and so at this point i can actually see that maybe the bug in my code is i shouldn't have used a while loop i should have maybe used an if statement where i'm only checking for this condition once so now that my while loop has changed to an if statement. I should be able to recompile my code and see what's changed so i can use make guess and then i'll run my code guess and when i guess three i guess i should get wrong guess so i'll do three and then i'll get wrong guess but also you're correct and at this point there's probably another bug in my code and so i'll actually leave this one up to you to use debug50 and see well why am i getting both wrong guess and you're correct
