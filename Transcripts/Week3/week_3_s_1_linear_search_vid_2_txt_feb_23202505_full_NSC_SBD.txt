Linear search is an algorithm we can use to find an element in an array an algorithm recall is a step by step set of instructions for completing a task the linear search algorithm works as follows iterate across the array from left to right looking for a specified element in pseudo code which is a more distilled version of this sentence if the first element is what you're looking for you can stop. Otherwise move to the next element and keep going over and over until you find the element or you don't so we can use the linear search algorithm for example to find the target value 9 in this array well we start at the beginning if it's what we're looking for we can stop it's not we're not looking for 11 so otherwise move to the next element so we look at 23 is 23 what we're looking for well no so we move on to the next element and the next element and we keep going through this process over and over and over until we land on a situation. Like this 9 is what we're looking for and this element of the array is value is 9 and so we found what we're looking for and we can stop the linear search has completed successfully but what about if we're looking for an element that's not in our array does linear search still work well sure so we repeat this process starting at the first element if it's what we're looking for we can stop it's not otherwise we move to the next element and we can keep repeating this process examining each element in turn hoping that we find. The number 50 but we won't know if we found the number 50 or if we didn't until we've stepped over every single element of the array only once we've done that and come up short can we conclude that 50 is not in the array and so the linear search algorithm well it failed per be but not in the sense that it was unsuccessful in doing what we asked it to do it was unsuccessful in as much as it didn't find 50 but 50 wasn't in the array but we have exhaustively searched through every single element and so while we didn't find anything. Still succeeds even if the element is not in the array so what's the worst case scenario with linear search well we have to look through every single element either because the target element is the last element of the array or the element we're looking for doesn't actually exist in the array at all what's the best case scenario well we might find the element immediately and how many elements do we then have to look at in the best case if we're looking for it and we find it at the very beginning we can stop immediately. What does this say about the complexity of linear search well in the worst case we have to look at every single element and so it runs in of of a in the worst case in the best case we're going to find the element immediately and so it runs in omega of 1 i'm doug lloyd this is cs50
